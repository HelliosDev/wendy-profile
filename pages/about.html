    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I'm only a normal student who really likes learning a lot. When i learn something new, i will not be afraid to take a risk because i've already had the knowledge to overcome the problem. I started learning programming a year ago. I like to create Android and Web Software.</p>
    <h5>My Motivation</h5>
    <blockquote>
        I like programming because I like challenge.
        Without challenge, my life will be boring.
